	  There was a couple of brands that I initially thought about when coming up with ideas. Nike and Adidas were two brands that initially stood out to me. I enjoyed Nike’s black and white colors on the webpage accompanied by large images of merchandise. This made the website look clean and simple. I went to the Adidas website and found a similar design layout, black and white with large images. I concluded that although black and white looked great, it seemed to be too common. I wanted to draw inspiration from a website that was a little more unique than that. That’s when I found Tesla’s website. A car/renewable energy company. Elon Musk is an entirely separate conversation, but I appreciated the design of the company. Clean and simple webpages with well-designed information boxes found throughout the website. What I enjoyed the most was the background images of nature. This makes me think that this company is a clean energy company and that maybe my purchase can help global warming. Once I felt that I knew the design was powerful. Therefore, Tesla is my favorite brand company.  </h3>

			  <h2>Why Telsa?</h2>
	  <h3 class="text-center">
	Tesla’s website provides straight forward information about the company. No ads, random boxes full of nonsense or annoying chat popups asking for information. Just a clean info webpage. The background images of nature with the combination of Gotham style font were my favorite about the website. The white Gotham style text made the words pop right off the webpage while still not taking away from the beautiful nature images. Even with lighter nature images the white text worked great. With darker nature images the text looked the best and really brought the website to life. This website had outstanding contrast and that is why I chose tesla for inspiration.

		  <h2>What do I plan to use?</h2>
	  <h3 class="text-center">
	I plan to use nature images for my background images. I also plan to use either open sans, lato or Gotham style font for my text. I thought of other colors I might use but I concluded that white would create the best contrast. The nature images will take up the top part of the website with the bottom content being a white background.

	The people that we built the house for changed my life forever. They were the nicest and happiest people I had ever met in my life. People that lived with no ac, plumbing, tv, electronics or electricity. People that had literally nothing but the clothes on there backs. Happy? How could this be? This really made me so grateful for what I had in my life. I realized to that day I should never complain about what I have or didn’t have in life. My life is a blessing and I always needed to remain humble and thankful for everything I have in life. I carry this mentality every day and I thank God for what I have in life. We are all truly blessed to live in houses with ac, plumbing, tv’s, electronics and electricity. Materialistic things don’t make people happy, only being content with oneself will make you happy. This experience changed my life for the better and I personally think I am a better person now because of the mission trip I went on.
