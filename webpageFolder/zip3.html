    <h1 class="text-center">Research - Do Video Games Cause Violence in Children?</h1>
    <hr>
	<h3 class="text-center">
	  In a new age of television and computers, companies have more influence on the population more than ever in history. Companies have entire departments dedicated to how you perceive certain products or media. Many people believe the same is true when discussing video games. People believe that violent video games makes children/teens violent citizens. Is this true? With companies influencing the masses more than ever it is not a stretch to think video games influence young adolescent minds. On the contrary, people believe that children/teens don’t get more violent due to video games since many video games aren’t realistic. We will look further into whether or not violent video games affect young adolescent minds.   </h3>

			  <h2>Video Games Affect my Kids Mind! Ban Violent Video Games!</h2>
	  <h3 class="text-center">
	Parents in the early 2000’s found out that violent video games could potentially affect their children’s minds.  This conversation was sparked by a now controversial study that suggested that violent video games can make children more aggressive. In this article, the research paper suggests that violent video games can increase aggression [1]. Articles like this started to fear patents into believing video games were harmful to their kids minds. What accelerated this belief was news stations picking up this story and doing stories on this topic. Articles like this [2], claim that video games have a link to aggression. News propaganda plus a few research papers have led many parents believing that violent video games affect their kids in a negative way. What research has shown that this might not be the case. The research paper that parents and news providers often cite might not be flawless. The testing pool that was used for the study was not an accurate pool of subjects to make the findings conclusive. With this in mind this leads me to conclude that the accuracy of these claims are not solid. Is there evidence to support that there is no connection between violent video games and violence with players?

			  <h2>Video Games Might not be as Bad as Some Might Think</h2>
	  <h3 class="text-center">
	 In this research paper [3], the author argues that the main problem with linking violence in adolescence to video games is how parents gauge the aggressive behavior. This basically means that it’s difficult to track the direct link to video games and aggressive behavior which makes the claim difficult to say with certain. People attempt to link violent behavior including school shootings to violent video games. To this day there is no evidence that video games have a direct link to real world acts of violence. The fact of the matter is that many teens are playing violent video games. To suggest that all of them would therefore be aggressive would be false because that doesn’t reflect real world data. Teens that play violent video games are normal teens playing something that they enjoy. Players don’t focus on the violent aspects of the games like some think. What really drives video games is the competition or entertainment of games. Games like call of duty are cited a lot to be the root of violent video games. Games like call of duty promote a competitive game for users that focuses of team work and skill. This game isn’t just about seeing violent acts occur on the screen. Many violent video games aren’t violent driven and instead are focused on skill.

	  <h2 class="text-center">Conclusion</h2>
		 <h3 class="text-center">
	With the research I conducted I conclude that there is no direct link between aggressive behavior to violent video games. To assume that all violent video game players are aggressive is false. Most if not all understand that what they are seeing is fake and otherwise unacceptable real world behavior. Players are mostly entertained by these games because of the completive nature and not the violence like some claim. The debate is passionate and rightfully so. We as a nation have become increasingly more violent with gun violence. This can be cause by many of reasons but to conclude that it’s because of violent video games is false. Video games are here and here to stay.
