    <h1 class="text-center">My Trip to the Dominican Replublic</h1>
    <hr>
	<h3 class="text-center">
	  A past event that changed my life was going to the Dominican Republic with my father. In 2017 me and my father decided that we wanted help others in the world that are unfortunately less fortunate than us. We came across a mission trip that built homes for local families in the Dominican Republic and we knew this was for us. I was initially nervous to go to a foreign country and be in a place I had never been before, but I trusted my gut to go. </h3>

	  <h3 class="text-center">
	The trip was one weeklong, two days of travel and five days of work. We had the job of taking an empty lot and turning it into a house in five days. I had my doubts we could complete construction with that amount of time. The first day on the job we got to meet the family we were building the house for. It was a family of seven people and they previously lived in a house the size of a bathroom. The family was very nice and even helped us build the house. The second day we poured and shaped the concrete for the house’s foundation. The final three days were spent building the houses structure and siding. In all, we were able to finish the house on time and give a loving family a new house. The building portion of the trip wasn’t what changed my life. It was the unbelievable people I met there.

	The people that we built the house for changed my life forever. They were the nicest and happiest people I had ever met in my life. People that lived with no ac, plumbing, tv, electronics or electricity. People that had literally nothing but the clothes on there backs. Happy? How could this be? This really made me so grateful for what I had in my life. I realized to that day I should never complain about what I have or didn’t have in life. My life is a blessing and I always needed to remain humble and thankful for everything I have in life. I carry this mentality every day and I thank God for what I have in life. We are all truly blessed to live in houses with ac, plumbing, tv’s, electronics and electricity. Materialistic things don’t make people happy, only being content with oneself will make you happy. This experience changed my life for the better and I personally think I am a better person now because of the mission trip I went on.
